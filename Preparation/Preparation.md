Conclusion:

I have realised a project with the Sql language and C#, using the applications Visual Studio Comunnity, Sql Server Management Studio. I have learned a lot about how to create a database linking different tables, how to connect a database and connect it to an application, I have also learned how to encrypt passwords and send confirmation messages via email, thus avoiding that they can be stolen and providing greater security to my project. The timetable set for my project has been met, helping me to organise my work better and I am satisfied with my work because I think I have learnt a lot and everything I have learnt will be useful for my future.
